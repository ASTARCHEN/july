Welcome to July
================

July is the best season for Tornado_ , it's all about how to organize a
tornado project. It is inspired by Django and Flask, I love Blueprint in Flask,
I love the app concept in Django. But I love Tornado the best.

And therefore, I create this project to make it possible for organizing tornado
project in Flask Blueprint way.
