Installation
============

The required library is Tornado_, and an optional library is SQLAlchemy_.
Although SQLAlchemy is optional, you should install it if you want a better solution
for database.

Tornado is a web server, and July Tornado is built on it. SQLAlchemy is a powerful database
engine, July Tornado provides an easy way to integrate it with Tornado.

virtualenv
----------

Virtualenv is probably what you want to use during development,
and if you have shell access to your production machines,
youâ€™ll probably want to use it there, too.

It is strongly suggested that you develop on virtualenv.

If you are on Linux or Mac OS X, you can install it with::

    $ sudo pip install virtualenv

if you have no pip::

    $ sudo easy_install virtualenv

And you should use **pip** instead of easy_install, install pip with::

    $ sudo easy_install pip

If you are on Windows, you should try **MinGW** or **Cygwin** .

Read document of virtualenv for a better life. But you can start now with::

    $ mkdir ~/env
    $ virtualenv ~/env/july

When the installation is finished, active this virtual environment::

    $ source ~/env/july/bin/active

Now, you are on a virtual environment called july. Any python package will be installed
on this july environment now::

    $ pip install july
    $ pip install SQLAlchemy


System-Wide Installation
------------------------

This could be easy, if you are on Linux or Mac OS X::

    $ sudo pip install july

if no pip available::

    $ sudo easy_install july


Install from Source
--------------------

If you have git installed::

    $ git clone http://github.com/lepture/july.git
    $ cd july
    $ python setup.py install
